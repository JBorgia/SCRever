Sleep and dream diary

SCREVER is a sleep tracking and dream diary app that is built using Atom and written in JavaScript. The app includes a stopwatch to track overall sleep time and allows users to create entries, complete with timestamps, for the logging of dreams or ideas. Additionally, users can rank how well they slept and review past entries, editting them and adding to them later to expand upon them. The theme is dark to ensure users have a great experience and is visually easy on the eyes at night.
